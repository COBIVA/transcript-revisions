# transcript-revisions
This project was developed to revise auto-generated transcripts from Microsoft Stream. The workflow includes a two-step process using R and R Studio. The first script is designed to remove extra lines of distracting and unnecessary information. Then, after an individual inserts speaker codes, the second script re-organizes the transcript according to the speaker. This project was developed by Ms. Jessica Draper in collaboration with Dr. Katherine Christoffersen, Dr. Ryan Bessett and Dr. Ana Carvalho and made possible in part through funding from the National Endowment of the Humanities.
